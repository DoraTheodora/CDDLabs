The Toolchain.

The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the Linux (unix) command line tools. We will specifically use:
Git for document versioning and management (c++ files in our case)
Emacs for editing
g++ for compiling
gdb for debugging
Make for managing code projects
Doxygen for documenting code

I will go through the following steps with you:

1.	Download the complete set of files using git to clone https://github.com/josephkehoe/CDD101
(If you are reading this then you have done this already ;-)
2.  	Find and open the file helloThreads.cpp using emacs (the graphical version of emacs is easier to use for beginners)
3.	Customise emacs to suit your tastes and examine the code to make sure you understand it
4.	Compile the file from the command line using the command "g++ -std=c++11 -pthread helloThreads.cpp"
5.	Run the file and check the output making sure you understand what has occured
6.	Copy the file Makefile1 to Makefile and examine using emacs
7.	Reopen helloThreads.cpp and try the compile option
8.	Copy the file Makefile2 to Makefile and examine using emacs
9.	Repeat for Makefile3
10.	Create a file containing the following code
#include <stdio.h>
 
main()
{
        int i;
        for(i=0;i<10;i++)
                printf("%d",i);
}

11.	Compile using -g -O0 switches
12.	Step through code using gdb
13.	Use Doxygen to generate documentation for the helloThreads.cpp code
