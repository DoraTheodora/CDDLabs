When Signal is executed by a thread, we also have two possibilities\+: The queue of S has no waiting thread The counter of S is increased by one and the thread resumes its execution. The queue of S has waiting threads In this case, the counter of S must be zero (see the discussion of Wait above). One of the waiting threads will be allowed to leave the queue and resume its execution. The thread that executes Signal also continues. ~\newline
